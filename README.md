# Guess The Number
A fun game to show students the potential for growing complexity out of simplicity

## Background
Many students who want to learn to program want to program games. I find this to be natural and how I learned as well. To become better at programming games, you have to program MORE GAMES! And, as far as games go, I cannot think of a simpler one than Guess the number. 

## Goal
Using the simplest form of Guess The Number, we will show that we can incrementally grow our game from silly easy and not much fun to something interesting, complex, and fun!

## This Version
The master branch is where the bulk of development is taking place. Granted, this is a more traditional form of version control than git is ideally used for, but it works well for this.

The idea here is that each branch is a different form of this same game. Some are more elaborate than others, some are greatly more elaborate creating a game only just barely related to guessing numbers.
