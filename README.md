# Guess The Number
A fun game to show students the potential for growing complexity out of simplicity

## Background
Many students who want to learn to program want to program games. I find this to be natural and how I learned as well. To become better at programming games, you have to program MORE GAMES! And, as far as games go, I cannot think of a simpler one than Guess the number. 

## Goal
Using the simplest form of Guess The Number, we will show that we can incrementally grow our game from silly easy and not much fun to something interesting, complex, and fun!

## This Version
This version is still the same game, but with some extra features. Namely, it does basic IO, try clauses, helper functions, recursion and data validation.

The new feature for users is that the concept of a high score has been introduced. To accomplish this, persistance had to be considered. We created a file to store the most recent high score (which turns out to be the "low" score since the goal is to guess in as few tries as possible.
