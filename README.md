# Guess The Number
A fun game to show students the potential for growing complexity out of simplicity

## Background
Many students who want to learn to program want to program games. I find this to be natural and how I learned as well. To become better at programming games, you have to program MORE GAMES! And, as far as games go, I cannot think of a simpler one than Guess the number. 

## Goal
Using the simplest form of Guess The Number, we will show that we can incrementally grow our game from silly easy and not much fun to something interesting, complex, and fun!

## This Version
This branch introduces a simple combat mechanism and give the play and his new opponent names! The random name generator is rather fun.

This branch is the first branch to really start to take the guess a number game into a weird direction, but still keep it within the same theme as the original.
